What I attempt to do is create a tool taht extracts memory location that is not allocated by the symbol table. When memory is dumped you can use the volitity framework to use a symbol table to find what you are looking for. But there is all of that other stuff in the memory that we do not know what it is. I will find what is looked for in the symbol table and then subtract that from the memory to find out what we don't know. 

I will be using perl for this.
